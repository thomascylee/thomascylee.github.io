                        Everyday, I've collected and analyzed market data for Fixed Deposit Pricing to enhance our bank's financial position and gain more deposit.
                        Also, throughout a Customer Segmentation Review Project, I've learnt how to properly identify potential corporate clients. 
                        And my manger has guided me to write Standard Operating Procedure documents for internal guideline of Personal RMB Service. 
                        It was a great time to have basic knowledge about banking environment so I got more ideas to determine my graduate career path.</p>
